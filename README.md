## SETS HashSet TreeSet LinkedHashSet

All three implement the Set interface, which means they store unique elements and don't allow duplicates.
They offer methods to add, remove, check for membership of elements, and get the size of the set.

# Key Differences:

## Ordering:

- HashSet: Doesn't maintain any specific order for elements. The order you iterate over the elements might differ each time. (Think of a box of loose balls - no particular arrangement)
- TreeSet: Maintains elements in ascending order by their natural ordering or a custom comparator you provide. (Think of sorted books on a shelf)
- LinkedHashSet: Retains the insertion order you add elements. (Imagine queuing up at a store - the order you join stays the same)

## Performance:

- HashSet: Generally the fastest for adding, removing, and checking for membership due to its unordered nature (think of quickly throwing balls in a box - fast and easy)
- TreeSet: Slower than HashSet because it needs to maintain order after each operation (like sorting books on a shelf - takes some effort)
- LinkedHashSet: Slightly slower than HashSet as it maintains an internal linked list for insertion order (like remembering your position in a queue - adds a little overhead)
